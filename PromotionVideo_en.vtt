00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Cut flowers. They are essential for enriching important life events

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.000
such as a first date to your wedding day.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Not only for celebrations,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
cut flowers can also be displayed on a shelf in your room 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
or presented in token of your gratitude.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes, cut flowers are everywhere.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.000
Of course, even during an iGEM meeting which never seems to end…

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.000
They are here on the desk to brighten the atmosphere!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.000
But do you know that most of these flowers are discarded before reaching the hands of the consumers?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
There is a serious and constant problem of flower loss:

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
more than 30% of flowers are wasted without being sold.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.000
The overall amount of flower waste is estimated to be three times larger than that of food waste.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
Existing solutions rely on chemicals,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.000
such as pesticides or antimicrobials,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.500
which may pose a risk on human health and the natural environment.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.500
There are many different causes of flower loss,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
such as viral infection,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000
insect pests,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000
flower aging, and damage by bacterial growth.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
We, Team Kyoto, propose to tackle this problem with solutions designed for each specific cause:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
CRISPR-based diagnostics for viral detection,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
RNA interference to kill insects and delay flower aging,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.300
and antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation to inhibit microbial
growth.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
To put our solutions into practice,

00:01:24:100 --> 00:01:27.300
there is a need for a way to supply a sufficient amount of
bioreagents

00:01:27:400 --> 00:01:28.700
such as RNA or proteins.

00:01:28:900 --> 00:01:31.000
We propose a novel synthetic platform

00:01:31:200 --> 00:01:35.000
that enables stable and efficient production of biomolecules.

00:01:36:000 --> 00:01:37.500
That being said, our solutions

00:01:37:500 --> 00:01:41.000
may not be capable of saving all flowers from being wasted…,

00:01:42:000 --> 00:01:41.000
but don’t worry,

00:01:43:500 --> 00:01:47.000
our flower recycling system can process flower waste into bioresources

00:01:47:500 --> 00:01:51.000
that now can be used as biostimulants in flower production.

00:01:47:500 --> 00:01:54.500
From Laboratories, to Flowers.
